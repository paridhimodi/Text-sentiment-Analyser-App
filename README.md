# Text-sentiment-Analyser-App

In this project I created a web application that predicts the sentiment of the text by analysing text. Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing (product/movie review, tweet, etc.) is positive, negative or neutral. It can be used to identify the customer or followerâ€™s attitude towards a brand through the use of variables such as context, tone, emotion, etc. 

**My application is live at: https://text-sentiment-analyser.herokuapp.com/**

## Steps taken to build this application:

1. Collecting data
2. Preprocess data
3. Created the custom embeddings with Word2Vec
4. Build the RNN neural network and trained it
5. Saved the model and tokenizer file.
6. Created the Flask framework for the API
7. Deployed the application on the cloud (Heroku)
